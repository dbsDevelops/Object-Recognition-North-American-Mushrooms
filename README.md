In this project, we have trained and evaluated a model with the YoloV5 object detection library. The link to the repository cloned con be found here: [YoloV5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git). The dataset used was shared by Amanda Morrow on April 2021, here is a link to the dataset: [Roboflow](https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/na-mushrooms). In addition we used a sanitized version which can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/ivanbisimbrero/NorthAmericanMushrooms.git) and an extended version of a dataset with new images and their respectives labels in [this respository](https://github.com/dbsDevelops/North-American-Mushrooms-Extended.git)
